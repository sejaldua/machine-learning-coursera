- Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to *learn* from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, it its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
  - Example: playing checkers
    - E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
    - T = the task of playing checkers
    - P = the probability that the program will win the next game
